# makers-bnb

This project is a clone of AirBnB which will allow users to list and book spaces.

MVP:
As a user I view all spaces
As a user I can select a space and view details of it (description of the space, price per night and availability)


###

As a user I can add new spaces
As a user I can book a space and view a confirmation page with the details of the booking
